The game will serve as a sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and a continuation of the narrative established there, and will carry over the same tagline of Tactical Espionage Operations first used in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. Set in 1984, the game follows the mercenary leader Venom Snake as he ventures into Africa and Afghanistan during the Soviet war to exact revenge on the people who destroyed his forces and nearly himself during the post-events of Ground Zeroes.
