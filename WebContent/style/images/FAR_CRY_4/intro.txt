Far Cry 4 offers a variety of weapons, including sidearms, shot guns, assault and sniper rifles, and heavy weapons such as machine guns and rocket launchers. These can be purchased at stores throughout the game world, or taken from fallen enemies. Weapons can be customised and upgraded to improve performance, and the completion of side-quests will unlock "signature" weapons, one-of-a-kind high-performance variations of stock models. The player is initially limited in the number of weapons that they can carry and the amount of ammunition that they can hold.
The game world is divided into two halves, North and South Kyrat. The player starts in South Kyrat, and is free to explore almost immediately, but can only unlock North Kyrat over the course of the story. The map is progressively opened up by liberating bell towers, freeing them from Pagan Min's influence and allowing the Golden Path to expand. The player will also encounter outposts, or enemy checkpoints that need to be captured by eliminating all soldiers. Four larger outposts, or fortresses, can also be found, featuring stronger defences and more difficult combinations of enemies. Liberating bell towers and clearing outposts will unlock further side-quests including escort missions, hostage rescues and hunting missions.
